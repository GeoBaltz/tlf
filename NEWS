tlf-1.1.0
=========

Major release. Besides a lot of fixed bugs it provides some new features and 
internal improvements.
Thanks to all of you for pointing out bugs, submitting ideas and testing.
To name some without any order of ranks: Ben NJ8J, Martin OK1RR, Fred DM3MF,i
Andy G4KNO, Rob N6ROB and Graham VE3GTC. 

New features:
    - move tlf sources to public github repository (http://github.com/TLF/tlf)

    - implement a new bandmap function (see doc/New_Bandmap.txt for details)
      * move score display in upper right corner of display to make room for 
        the bandmap
      * Ctrl-A adds an observed station as spot to the bandmap and 
        broadcasts it to other stations in the LAN
      * Drop old SPOTLIST display (superseded by new bandmap)

    - changes in logcfg.dat handling !Fix your contest rules!
      * allow >9 points for any point scoring 
      * drop old unneeded keywords (MANY_CALLS, SPOTLIST, FILTER)
      * fixed keywords for CQ_TU_MSG, VKCQM and VKSPM according to manual
      * BANDMAP=<xxx>,<nn> allows configuration of the new bandmap display 
        (see man page)

    - Send VKCQM and VKSPM voice messages after end of QSO in SSB. 
    - Use external user adaptable script 'play_vk' for playing of 
      SSB voice key messages

    - add list of 'usa_canada' states and general 'contest' rules file 
      to installation files

    - drop special handling for TenTec ORION (correctly handled by hamlib in 
      meantime)

    - changed handling of comments for WYSIWYG_ONCE and WYSIWYG_MULTI
      Old code stopped multi recognition at first space in comment string. 
      Changed to use whole string but strip trailing spaces. Was so back 
      before tlf-0.9.21

    - Better handling of lines from external multiplier file
      * Allow comment lines (starting with '#')
      * strip leading and trailing whitespace
      * drop empty lines
         
    - New actual cty.dat file (December 2011). Thanks Martin OK1RR.

Fixed bugs:
    - segfaults due to a racing condition if heavy load on cluster
    - '+' and 'INSERT' keys in call and exchange input field respects
      CTCOMPATIBLE mode now
    - Allow edit of old QSO's only if call field is empty
    - Fix display of section in ARRL_SS and recognition of 'U' precedent
    - Fix upper boundaries for 160 and 40 meters.
    - Correct rescoring for WYSIWYG_* methods
    - keywords in logcfg.dat needs to start at column 0
    - correction of spelling errors and drop of old infos from man page
    - a lot of fixes of old problems:
      * proper locking to prevent racing conditions 
      * fix bad scoring of multis
      * correct position of pfx display in bottom line of check window
      * correct display of 1A stations in info line
      * wrong return value from searchcallarray
      * wrong handling of corner cases for some internal array scans

Reworked internal structure:
    - did some modernisation of configure.ac
    - start to use ncurses panel functions for overlapping windows and
      glib-2 for effective handling of large data collections
    - switch cty data handling and mults_possible to growing arrays and
      therefore allowing unlimited number of entries
    - simplify and drop unneeded code


tlf-1.0.0
=========

Major cleanup release. Fixes lot of buffer overruns in string handling, which 
stopped old version from working with new GCC and GLIBC.
 * Better recognition of hamlib install (tnx F8FCE) 
 * Rewrote handling of initial exchange file. It now allows empty 
   and comment lines (#) and spaces around the callsign. Leading 
   space before comment gets ignored.
 * Changed ESC handling in comment and call input field:
   Does no longer wipe out call and exchange field if you started sending.
 * New callmaster and cty.dat file (tnx OK1RR).

Bugfixes:
 * Fix input handling of notes.
 * Fix autocq handling. 
   - First characters gets no longer swallowed.
   - CQDELAY from logcfg.dat is now handled correct.
 * fix calculation of sunrise and sunset times 
 * fix calculation of QSO Rate
 * fix parsing for MARKERDOTS and MARKERCALL keywords in logcfg.dat
 * make Backspace and Delete-Keys the same to allow some more terminal 
   input encodings
