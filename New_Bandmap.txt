New Bandmap in TLF-1.1 !!!VERY EARLY PREVIEW!!!
======================

One main poblem in old TLF versions is the very narrow space for cluster
messages (only 8 entries plus some room in scrolling). Furthermore the code
for looking up the messages was very inefficient and does not allow good
filtering of the informations we need.

The new bandmap tries to fix some of the problems. The following principles
were applied:

- Use the space below the QSO entry line for displaying the spots in the
  background.
- For each spot display the frequency (with one decimal) and the call of the
  spotted station. That allows 3 columns with 10 spots each.
- There are 3 sources of spots:
  * dx cluster messages
  * spots in local LAN (maybe from other stations scanning the band)
  * finished QSOs while in S&P
- The frequency is remembered with a resolution of 1 Hz if available
- You can filter the displayed spots by
  * band (all bands or only own (momentarily active) band)
  * mode (all or own)
  * dupe (show dupes or not)
- Each spot may have a letter or star between frequency and call denoting the 
  source of the spot
  * blank - from cluster
  * '*' - self spotted or worked in S&P
  * 'a'..'z' -spotted from station 'a' to 'z' in local network
- Color of spots signal the age of the spot
  * bright blue - new spot
  * blue - older than 45s (at the moment)
  * brown - older than 5 min 
- Dupes (already work stations) are show in lower case and grey

USAGE
===== 

Turn on rig support and connect to a cluster (experiment what happens if one
or both conditions are not met). Wait some moments until some spots shows up.

- Press '.' to show the filter menu. Next letter switches filtering:
  * b - toggle band filter
  * m - toggle mode filter
  * d - toggle display of dupes
- Tune in to any interesting station, insert its call into the input field
  and press 'Ctrl-A'. The heard station gets added to the bandmap and
  broadcasted to other stations in the local net. See that it gets marked with
  a '*' as self spotted.
- Tune in to any contest station in S&P and work it as normal. After the QSO
  is finished the station is added to the bandmap and shown as dupe.
- Press 'Ctrl-G' to grab the next displayed spot (starting at your frequency
  upwards). Each further press of 'Ctrl-G' jumps to the next spot. So you can
  scan the spotted stations, see if you can work them or jump to the next one.
  If you reach the last station (highest frequency) the scan switches
  direction and following key presses goes downward (on lower boundary it
  switches to upwrds again...).
- If you grab a spot while in 'Run' mode, TLF switches to S&P and remembers
  your 'run' frequency in the memory.
