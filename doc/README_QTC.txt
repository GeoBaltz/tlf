Introduction
============

QTC handling was maded for WAEDC contest for Tlf. It doesn't need
any external tool, Tlf supports it out of box. To enable that,
only needs to put the "QTC" option to logcfg.dat. This parameter
needs a value, which could be one of these: "RECV", "SEND", or
"BOTH". These values means you only want to receive or send
QTC's, or you want to send AND receive QTC's (for example, in
RTTY mode). Note, that currently only the RECV and SEND are
implemented. Both will used for RTTY mode.


QTC window
==========

When you enabled the QTC in logcfg.dat, you can open it from from
either field: callsign or exchange, it doesn't matter. To open
that, just press CTRL+Q. If you want to close that, just simple
press ESC. The window is divided to 2 site: the left site
contains the QTC's data, the right site contains the help.

The data site contains the QTC's fields:
* QTC callsign - 14 characters, allowed: alphanums, digits, /
* QTC serial - 4 characters, allowed: digits,
* number of QSO in current QTC block - 2 characters, allowed:
  digits
* 10 QSO lines in RECV mode:
  * time - 4 characters, allowed: digits, ?
  * callsign - 14 characters, allowed: alphanums, digits, /, ?
  * serial - 4 characters, allowed: digits, ?
* 10 QSO lines in SEND mode:
  * every line generated by the QSO's, all of them are formatted
    for three fields: time, callsign and serial

This site contains many "meta" information:
* at right of the QTC callsing field, Tlf shows the QTC info of
  current stations: how many QTC has it; if the callsign field
  in main window is empty, the last callsign will be pivked up.
  When the station not send or received yet any QTC, there will
  be this value: "Received 0 QTC", or "Sent 0 QTC". If you had
  changed any QTC with station, the message is "Received 3 QTC",
  or "Sent 5 QTC".
* if you type the number of QSO in the QTC block in RECV mode,
  Tlf will shows its number at the begin of every line; if the
  station indicates that it will send to you 6 QSO, and you type
  it that field, Tlf will put a digit to the begin of first 6
  lines
* if you type the number of QSO in the QTC block in SEND mode,
  Tlf will find the next number QSO, which doesn't contain the
  current callsign (see contest rules 7.2). Note, that if you
  don't have eonugh QSO, you can't send the maximum (10), eg.
  you have only 9 QSO. If you type greater number than available
  QTC number, the field value will be aligned to maximum number!
* in RECV mode, every QSO line has a status, which could be:
  "invalid", "valid", "confirmed". This status is indicated by a
  sign at the end of the line. When a line is invalid, you can
  see a "?", if the line is valid, then there isn't any character,
  and finally, if the QSO line had been confirmed, you can see
  a "*" sign
* in SEND mode, if you've sent a QTC line (with ENTER), at the
  end of the line you will see a "*" character, which means,
  you've sent that QTC


Navigation between the fields
=============================

You can move to any fields as you want and when you want. There
isn't mandatory order, but the navigation keys doesn't works in
all cases. Normally, with TAB you can move to the next field,
which followed by current, and Shift+TAB goes back. There is an
exception: if you in a QSO line, till you don't confirm the line,
TAB doesn't takes away, it takes to the time field, if you are in
the exchange field, and Shift+TAB does it in reverse mode.
With UP and DOWN cursor keys you can go to up or down.

In RECV mode with SPACE, you can navigate between the fields in one
line, for faster move, so that mean the SPACE and TAB are equals
this mode, in QTC line.


Navigation in a field
=====================

If you press an allowed character in a field, that will be
showed, and the cursor will goes to right next place. If you
press a not allowed character, then nothing happens. The
BACKSPACE key deletes the next charaters to left, and move the
right part to left. DELETE key deletes the current character as
you're staying, and shifts the characters to left at the next to
right. As I described above, the SPACE move the cursor to the next
field (or first, if you are in last field) inside of QTC line, in
RECV mode.


Storing QTC's
=============

Tlf stores QTC's in two files. The received QTC's are stored in
QTC_recv.log, sent QTC's are stored in QTC_sent.log. These logfiles
will created automatically, when Tlf starts.


Receiving QTC
=============

If the station asks you, are you QRV for QTC, you can press the
CTRL+Q, it doesn't matter in which field are you: callsign or
exchange. Another way, you open the QTC window (CTRL+Q), and press
F1 - that configured in rule file to send "QTC?".

If the callsign fields isn't empty, the content of that field
will be copied. Elsewhere the callsign of the last QSO will be
copied. If station sent QTC previously, you can see the number
of QTC QSO's, eg. "Received 3 QTC". You can receive maximum 10
QTC from every station. If you have 3 QTC from a station, then
you can receive 7 QTC. If you type more than 7, Tlf will replace
the number to 7.

Then you can fill the QTC serial, and number of QSO's. What you
type as number of QSO's, Tlf will numbering so much lines, to
helps to see, how many lines remain.

If you filled the callsign, serial and number fields (all three
fields are required), and at this time you press ENTER, then
Tlf will send the F2 message, which is "QRV" normally, so you don't
need to send by manually.

If you start to receive the QTC's, you need to fill 3 fields:
time (HHMM, as hour and minutes), callsign and serial. If you
enter to a line, that line will be marked as "incomplete", that
you can see a "?" at the end of that line.

If you fill the time field (4 digits), the cursor will goes to
the callsign field. Fill that field, and press TAB to move the
next one. If you put to there at least 1 digit, Tlf recognizes
that line is complete, and "?" will disappear at the end of the
line.

If you press SPACE in any field, the cursor will goes to the next
field (or first, if the current is the exchange number).

Important: in any fields you can type "?", eg: "111?" in time
field, or "W?" in callsign field. That mean, you couldn't receive
that letter. Then you fill all fields vainly, the line remain as
incomplete. Elsewhere, Tlf assumes the line is complete.

This is important, because when you press the ENTER, Tlf will
send the answer to station based the status of the line. If the
line is incomplete, Tlf sends "AGN" message, but if it's
complete, it sends "R".

If you could receive the line, and pressed the ENTER, and Tlf
sent the "R" signal, then you will see a "*" at the end of the
line. That means, you receipt the QTC line from the station.

If you want to ask only one field (eg. only callsign), then you
need just press F5 (TIME?), F6 (CALL?), or F7 (NR?). If you want
to ask the complete QTC line, you can press F8 (AGN).

When you received a QTC, the cursor goes to the next line, to
the time field, and you can continue to receive the lines.

If you receive the last line, and all previous line are complete,
and the last one is complete too, then you press ENTER - now Tlf
will close the QTC window, and send "QSL ALL" message to
station.

At this time the QTC datas will be writed to the logfile on the
disk, fields will be flushed, and if there is configured any
other node in logcfg.dat, then QTC lines will be sent to them.

On the other nodes, Tlf also will write the QTC's to its own
logfiles.

If you press ESC until you receive the QTC block, the data isn't
lost. Tlf flush's the fields in these cases:
* you received all QSO's, and saved to disc
* pressed ESC, and changed regular callsign field

Note, that Tlf send "QRV" message only that case, if the
fields are empty. Keep in mind, if you've pressed ESC, and CTRL+Q
again, all data remains, and "QRV" messages will NOT send.


Sending QTC
=============

If the station asks you, can you send one or more QTC's, you
can press the CTRL+Q, it doesn't matter in which field are you:
callsign or exchange. If the QTC window opened, you can press
the F2, then Tlf will send the message: "QTC sr/nr" - but the
"sr" and "nr" signs will replaced with the serial and number of
lines in QTC, example: "QTC 3/8".

If the callsign fields isn't empty, the content of that field
will be copied. If empty, the callsign of last QSO will be copied.
If station received QTC previously, you can see the number
of QTC QSO's on the current band, eg. "Sent 3 QTC". You can send
maximum 10 QTC to every station. If you sent 3 QTC to a station,
you can send maximum 7 QTC in next block. If you type more, than
7, Tlf will replace the number to 7, and of course, only 7 QSO
will shows. If you don't have enough QSO, Tlf also will replace
this value to the number of the available QSO.

The QTC serial field will be filled automatically, you just need
to set up, how many QTC's want to send. Note, that Tlf looks the
current callsign, and that will be excluded from the QTC list!
If you modify the callsign field, Tlf will hide some lines, which
matches the actually callsign, but don't afraid: if you finish
the modification of field, you can see the available list.

If you don't want to send the maximum available QTC lines, just
edit the number field, and Tlf will gives only that QTC lines.

Now, you can move to the 1st QTC line with DOWN cursor. If you press
ENTER, Tlf will send the current QTC, and will put a "*" char
to the end of the line. It shows you, that QTC line had been sent.

Now just press DOWN and ENTER, if the station gives "R" sign. If
it asks the last QTC line, just simple press UP, and press ENTER
again. With the DEL key you can delete the "SENT" flag from the
end of the line.

If you sent all lines, and station confirm those, you can press
the CTRL+S (like in most software), and Tlf will save the block.
After 2 seconds the window will be closed, and you can go away.

At this time the QTC datas will be writed to the logfile on the
disk, callsign and number fields will be flushed, and if there
is configured any other node in logcfg.dat, then QTC lines will
be sent to them.

On the other nodes, Tlf also will write the QTC's to its own
logfiles.

If you press ESC until you receive the QTC block, the data isn't
lost. Tlf flush's the fields in these cases:
* you sent all QSO's, and saved to disc



Showing QTC capable stations 
============================

After you send or receive a QTC block from or to a station, Tlf
writes it to the log, but it stores in the memory too. Then, if
you meet that station on another bands, and use "Worked window",
then you can see, how many QTC's had been sent the station on
each band.

There is a "Q" letter on the border of "Worked window", and in
that column there are the number of QTC's. If there is "0" in a
line, that means you sent to or received from QTC from that
station. If there is a "Q", that means you sent to or received
from the station the maximum number of QTC (10).

This information also visible in cluster info, if you use that.
At the end of the callsign in bandmap, you can see a "0", "Q" or
any digit, which means same as above, eg "DL1A  Q", or "HA5A  3".


Making CABRILLO
===============

If you finish the contest, just write ":wri" in callsign field,
then Tlf will save your log in Cabrillo format. It's a good idea
to exit from Tlf, and start it again - this is only need to recalc
correct points, nothing else.

Now leave the Tlf, and run the "qtcmerge.py" script, which is part
of Tlf, and normally it has been installed to your
INSTALLDIR/share/tlf, eg. /usr/local/share/tlf. The normal way to
run this script from the Tlf contest directory is this:

/usr/local/share/tlf/qtcmerge.py YOURCALL.cbr

Now the script reads your saved Cabrillo file, and write your QTC's
to a new file, in Cabrillo format. The new file name will be
YOURCALL_QTC.cbr. Save the original file, rename this new one to
regular YOURCALL.cbr, and you can send it to organizers.

Note, that you can find more info about the QTC's cabrillo format
